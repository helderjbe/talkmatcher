# TalkMatcher

A web app that allows random people to talk to each other through voice (only). Can be done as groups or one on one.
Uses WebRTC Peerconnection for audio capture and socket.io for signaling.

If you inspect closer at src, there is a file missing, called auth.js. It contains crypto logic to generate keys for the TURN server.
I will remake this app as a newer version with React, but I will use the same auth logic, so naturally I will not leave it here for public display.
You don't need this file anyway, a TURN server is optional and not required for this project to function.

Apologies for a short README, as I am spending time remaking this app. Do send me a message if you need anything. I will make sure to answer it.

Enjoy.
